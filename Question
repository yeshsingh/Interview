Intro:-
Hello, I'm Yesh Singh from Ballia, Uttar Pradesh. I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science at VIT Bhopal University, where I maintain a CGPA of 8.67. 
I began my academic journey at Holy Cross School in Ballia, completing my secondary and higher secondary education with percentages of 89.6 and 84.5, respectively.
My passion for competitive programming is a significant part of my profile. I've represented my college twice in the prestigious ACM ICPC, achieving All India Ranks of 115 in the Mathura region and 113 in the Amritapuri region.
Additionally, I placed 308th out of over 1,30,000 participants in TCS Codevita 2023. 
I also participated in Google Kickstart and CodeJam early in my college journey, which further honed my skills. 
On LeetCode, I hold the title of Knight with a peak rating of 1853, and I'm recognized as a Pupil on Codeforces.
In addition to my competitive programming accomplishments, I have worked on projects like Medisync, a healthcare management system, and Algovisualizer, a web application for visualizing pathfinding algorithms. 
While my primary strength lies in competitive coding, where I have solved over 1,100 problems across various platforms and my projects showcase my ability to apply my problem-solving skills to real-world challenges.
Outside of programming, I enjoy playing football and chess, which helps me stay balanced and brings a different perspective to my problem-solving approach.
